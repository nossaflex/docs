## **iOS App**

Our *bread and butter*. This is where NOSSAFLEX began, and you can [<u>download the app today</u>](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/nossaflex/id1523558285). While we're actively working on expanding to Android to make it accessible to even more people, you can follow our progress by [<u>joining the conversation on Discord</u>](https://discord.com/invite/wMrKxED).

The app brings the The NOSSAFLEX System to life, allowing you to log your film camera settings along with descriptions, locations, and photo references, using our custom-built light meter. It’s a valuable tool for self-learning, helping you analyze patterns in your settings. Do you gravitate toward certain styles? What are your go-to settings? How do your reference photos compare to the final scans? It’s all about insight and growth.

## **Digital Downloads**

For those using digital cameras, we’ve created tools to integrate the NOSSAFLEX system with your setup. Whether you want to organize metadata or use our naming conventions, we’ve got you covered. Below, you’ll find programs (with an explainer video) that help you adapt our system to your digital workflow.
